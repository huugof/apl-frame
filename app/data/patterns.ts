    "solution": "Encourage a birth and death process for towns within the region, which gradually has these effects:\n1. The population is even distributed in terms of different sizes -- for example, one town with 1,000,000 people, 10 towns with 100,000 people each, 100 towns with 10,000 people each, and 1000 towns with 100 people each.\n2. These towns are distributed in space in such a way that within each size category the towns are homogeneously distributed all across the region.",

    "solution": "Define all farms as parks, where the public has a right to be; and make all regional parks into working farms.\nCreate stewardships among groups of people, families and cooperatives, with each stewardship responsible for one part of the countryside. The stewards are given a lease for one part of the land, and they are free to tend the land and set ground rules for its use -- as a small farm, a forest, marshland, desert, and so forth. The public is free to visit the land, hike there, picnic, explore, boat, so long as they conform to the ground rules. With such a setup, a farm near a city might have picnickers in its fields every day during the summer.",

Make sure that the subcultures are small enough, so that each person has access to the full variety of life styles in the subcultures near his own.",
    "relatedPatterns": "... the most basic structure of a city is given by the relation of urban land to open country -- [[City Country Fingers (3)]]. Within the swaths of urban land the most important structure must from from the great variety of human groups and subcultures which can co-exist there.\nWe imagine that the smallest subcultures will be no bigger than 150 feet across; the largest perhaps as much as a quarter of a mile -- [[Community of 7000 (12)]], [[Identifiable Neighborhood (14)]], [[House Cluster (37)]]. To ensure that the life cycles of each subculture can develop freely, uninhibited by those which are adjacent, it is essential to create substantial boundaries of nonresidential land between adjacent subcultures -- [[Subculture Boundary (13)]] ...\n---\n[!cite]- Alexander, Christopher. _A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction_.

    "relatedPatterns": "... this pattern helps the gradual evolution of [[Mosaic of Subcultures (8)]], by placing families and work together, and so intensifying the emergence of highly differentiated subcultures, each with its own character...\nThe scattered work itself can take a great variety of forms. It an occur in belts of industry, where it is essential for an industry to occupy an acre or more between subcultures -- [[Subculture Boundary (13)]], [[Industrial Ribbon (42)]]; it can occur in work communities, which are scattered among the neighborhoods -- [[Neighborhood Boundary (15)]], [[Work Community (41)]]; and it can occur in individual workshops, right among the houses -- [[Home Workshop (157)]].

    "problem": "There are few people who do not enjoy the magic of a great city. But urban sprawl takes it away from everyone except the few who are lucky enough, or rich enough, to live close to the largest centers.",
    "solution": "Put the magic of the city within reach of everyone in a metropolitan area. Do this by means of collective regional policies which restrict the growth of downtown areas so strongly that no one downtown can grow to serve more than 300,000 people. With this population base, the downtowns will be between two and nine miles apart.",
    "relatedPatterns": "... next to the [[Mosaic of Subcultures (8)]], perhaps the most important structural feature of a city is the pattern of those centers where the city life is most intense. These centers can help form the mosaic of subcultures by their variety; and they can also help to form [[City Country Fingers (3)]], if each of the centers is at a natural meeting point of several fingers. This pattern was first written by Luis Racionero under the name \"Downtown of 300,000\".\nTreat each downtown as a pedestrian and local transport area -- [[Local Transport Areas (11)]], [[Promenade (31)]], with good transit connections from the outlying areas -- [[Web of Public Transport (16)]]; encourage a rich concentration of night life within each downtown -- [[Night Life (33)]], and set aside at least some part of it for the wildest kind of street life -- [[Carnival (58)]], [[Dancing in the Street (63)]] ...\n---\n[!cite]- Alexander, Christopher. _A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction_.

    "solution": "Break the urban area down into local transport areas, each one between 1 and 2 miles across, surrounded by a ring road. Within the local transport area, build minor local roads and paths for internal movements on foot, by bike, on horseback, and in local vehicles; build major roads which make it easy for cars and trucks to get to and from the ring roads, but place them to make internal local trips slow and inconvenient.",
    "relatedPatterns": "... superimposed over the [[Mosaic of Subcultures (8)]], there is a need for a still larger cellular structure: the local transport areas. These areas, 1-2 mile across, not only help to form subcultures, by creating natural boundaries in the city, but they can also help to generate the individual city fingers in the [[City Country Fingers (3)]], an they can help to circumscribe each downtown area too, as a special self-contained area of local transportation -- [[Magic of the City (10)]].\nTo keep main roads for long distance traffic, but not for internal local traffic, lay them out as they parallel one way roads, and keep these parallel roads away from the center of the area, so that they are very good for getting to the ring roads, but inconvenient for short local trips -- [[Parallel Roads (23)]]. Lay out abundant footpaths and bike paths and green streets at right angles to the main roads, and make these paths for local traffic go directly through the center -- [[Green Streets (51)]], [[Network of Paths and Cars (52)]], [[Bike Paths and Racks (56)]]; sink the ring roads around the outside of each area, or shield the noise they make some other way -- [[Ring Roads (17)]]; keep parking to a minimum within the area, and keep all major parking garages near the ring roads -- [[Nine Per Cent Parking (22)]], [[Shielded Parking (97)]]; and build a major interchange within the center of the area -- [[Interchange (34)]] ...\n---\n[!cite]- Alexander, Christopher. _A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction_.

    "problem": "The mosaic of subcultures requires that hundreds of different cultures live, in their own way, at full intensity, next door to one another. But subcultures have their own ecology. They can only live at full intensity, unhampered by their neighbors, if they are physically separated by physical boundaries.",
    "solution": "Separate neighboring subcultures with a swath of land at least 200 feet wide. Let this boundary be natural—wilderness, farmland, water—or man-made—railroads, major roads, parks, schools, some housing. Along the seam between two subcultures, build meeting places, share functions, touching each community.",
    "relatedPatterns": "... the [[Mosaic of Subcultures (8)]] and its individual subcultures, whether they are a [[Community of 7000 (12)]] or an [[Identifiable Neighborhood (14)]], need to be completed by boundaries. In fact, the mere creation of the boundary areas, according to this pattern, will begin to give life to the subcultures between the boundaries, by giving them a chance to be themselves.\nNatural boundaries can be things like [[The Countryside (7)]], [[Sacred Sites (24)]], [[Access to Water (25)]], [[Pools and Streams (64)]], [[Still Water (71)]]. Artificial boundaries can include [[Ring Roads (17)]], [[Parallel Roads (23)]], [[Work Community (41)]], [[Industrial Ribbon (42)]], [[Teenage Society (84)]], [[Shielded Parking (97)]]. The interior organization of the subculture boundary should follow two broad principles. It should concentrate the various land uses to form functional clusters around activity -- [[Activity Nodes (30)]], [[Work Community (41)]].

Allow the high density to bulge in from the boundary, toward the center of gravity of the community, thus enlarging the eccentric nucleus toward the center.\n4. Continue this high density to form a ridge around the boundary in horseshoe fashion—with the length of the horseshoe dependent on the overall mean gross density, at that part of the city, and the bulge of the horseshoe toward the center of the region, so that the horseshoes form a gradient, according to their position in the region.

This means that any individual [[Community of 7000 (12)]] will have an overall density given by its distance from the nearest downtown. The question then arises: How should density vary locally, within this community; what geometric pattern should the density have? The question is complicated greatly by the principle of [[Subculture Boundary (13)]], which requires that communities are surrounded by their services, instead of having their services at their geometric centers. This pattern, and the next, defines a local distribution of density which is compatible with this context.\nGiven this overall configuration, now calculate the average densities at different distances from this ridge of high density, according to the computations given in the next pattern -- [[Density Rings (29)]]; keep major shopping streets and promenades toward the dense part of the horseshoe -- [[Activity Nodes (30)]], [[Promenade (31)]], [[Shopping Street (32)]]; and keep quiet areas toward the open part of the horseshoe -- [[Sacred Sites (24)]], [[Quiet Backs (59)]], [[Still Water (71)]] ...\n---\n[!cite]- Alexander, Christopher. _A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction_.

Indeed, where it is possible to construct forms of ownership which give people control over their houses and gardens, but make financial speculation impossible, choose these forms above all others. In all cases give people the legal power, and the physical opportunity to modify and repair their own places. Pay attention to this rule especially, in the case of high density apartments: build the apartments in such a way that every individual apartment has a garden, or a terrace where vegetables will grow, and that even in this situation, each family can build, and change, and add on to their house as they wish.",

For the shape of the lot, do not accept the common notion of a lot which has a narrow frontage and a great deal of depth. Instead, try to make every house lot roughly square, or even long along the street and shallow.

    "solution": "Do away, as far as possible, with internal staircases, in institutions. Connect all autonomous households, public services, and workgroups on the upper floors of buildings directly to the ground. Do this by creating open stairs which are approaches directly from the street. Keep the stair roofed or unroofed, according to climate, but at all events leave the stair open at ground level, without a door, so that the stair is functionally a continuation of the street. And build no upstairs corridors. Instead, make open landings or an open arcade where upstairs units share a single stair.",

Far more generally, it is true that many of the households, public services, and workgroups given by earlier patterns can be successful when they lie upstairs, only if they are given direct connections to the street. For instance, in a work community [[Self-Governing Workshops and Offices (80)]], [[Small Services Without Red Tape (81)]], [[Small Work Groups (148)]] all require direct access to the public street when they are on the upper stories of a building. And in the individual households - [[House for a Small Family (76)]], [[House for a Couple (77)]], [[House for One Person (78)]] also need direct connections to the street, so people do not need to go through lower floors to get to them. This pattern describes the open stairs which may be used to form these many individual connections to the street. They play a major role in helping to create [[Pedestrian Street (100)]].\nWhere the stair comes down to the ground, make an entrance which helps to repair the family of entrances that exist already on the street - [[Family of Entrances (102)]]; make the landings and the top of the stair, where it reaches the roof, into gardens where things can grow and where people can sit in the sun - [[Roof Garden (118)]], [[Sunny Place (161)]].

It also helps to generate [[Ceiling Height Variety (190)]].\nTo the extent consistent with [[Ceiling Height Variety (190)]], make walls and columns progressively shorter the higher you go in the building to keep slenderness ratios low.\nAnd make wall thicknesses and column thicknesses vary with the height - see [[Wall Membranes (218)]]. Our calculations, for a typical lightweight concrete building of the kind we have been discussing, suggest the following orders of magnitude for wall thicknesses: Top story - 2 inches thick; one below top story - 3 inches; two below top story - 4 inches; three stories below top (ground floor on a four story building) - 5 inches. Of course these numbers will change for different loads, or for different materials, but they show the type of variation you can expect.\nColumn thicknesses must be proportional to wall thicknesses, so that the thinnest walls have the thinnest columns. If they are very thin, it will be possible to make them simply by placing boards, or one thickness of material, outside the outer skins which form the wall membrane - see [[Wall Membranes (218)]].

    "solution": "On paths and terraces, lay paving stones with a 1 inch crack between the stones, so that grass and mosses and small flowers can grow between the stones. Lay the stones directly into the earth, not into mortar, and, of course, use no cement or mortar in between the stones.",
